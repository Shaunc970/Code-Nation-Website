    Hello Iâ€™m Shaun I was previously working as a hardware technician at a company in Bolton until it decided to go bust just before I could be furloughed how nice of them, this included everything from maintaining and upgrading PCs to setting up servers. I decided to come to Code Nation as I felt I wanted to get a better understanding of the other half of the industry plus to break back into the old skills I used to have from doing coding in high school and college.</p>
