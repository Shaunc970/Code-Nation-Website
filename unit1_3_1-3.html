   <h2>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>

   <p>
    I think if I were to do this project again I could make it more efficient in a number of ways:
    <br>
Teamwork<br>
I think one of the ways that would have been most helpful to make the project more efficient and productive would have been the use of teams. This has a number of advantages, the main one being divvying up the workload, just by its very nature we would be more efficient as the output of 3 people is more then one and this would allow us to produce more in the same time-span. Another advantage as well would be different skill sets a I believe my strengths lie on the back-end of software development and front-end such as CSS and colours and themes is my biggest weakness, If we were working in teams we could of played to each others strengths.The downside of teamwork however is that it takes time to manage the team, which could slow us down but thanks to the use of Trello I think this would be a moot point as all of the work could of been split into tasks and then members assigned to each task, the other drawback would of been the compiling of the code as this is extremely time consuming however once again thanks to VS Code, I don't think this would have been much of an issue as it has extensive error checking and a team member would be able to check if it doesn't work before sending it.
<br>
Planning<br>
I think the other way we could have been more productive is to use pre-planning more effectively. This could have avoided a lot of the drawbacks faced in the project. Plus we have the tool for it in the form of Trello one of the main issues I have faced was on the visual side changing colours and fonts before realising it doesn't look right, however if I had pre-planned a theme out on Trello their would of been a clearer picture and less edits. The drawback of this is mainly in time as it would take time to plan but the trade should be that the time saved overall would make it a benefit.</p>

        <h2>Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>When trying to improve productivity and efficiency can be split into two categories technical and personal:
            <br>
Personal<br>
Personal ways to improve productivity and efficiency are about things individuals can do themselves to improve their output this includes methods such as taking breaks, although it sounds counter intuitive it can actually help overall, as leaving a difficult task that you are stuck on by taking a break can actually help reset your thought patterns and when you return you can often work faster and clearer. Also it can help prevent fatigue that can be associated with working flat out.
<br>
Technical<br>
Technical refers to tools and software that help improve productivity, this can be software more specific for the task you are trying to achieve. For example while VSCode is a versatile interface this means it was not made for web development specifically and does not have quality of life features, that a more focused program made such as Dreamweaver or Bootstrap which can reduce a lot of the tedious parts of web development.</p>

            <h2>Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
           </div>
           <div  class="pstyle">
            <p>To improve my own productivity for my own digital projects what I would of done next time would been:
                <br>
                Teamwork:<br>
                The first thing that I would of done to have been more productive would of been to work in a team, this would of helped substantially with productivity this would of been for two main reasons. First the content output would of been a lot more as we could of split the workload been us.Considering that the main restraint of the project was time this would of allowed us to be a lot further into development before the deadline, to ensure that we were working efficiently we would of used Trello to split the work between the team.Teamwork would have also helped to get around the weaknesses of the project as without a doubt my weakest aspect of the project is CSS and the user interface side if we were in teams we could of shared the work out according to our strengths and sures up any weaknesses each of us have.</p>
