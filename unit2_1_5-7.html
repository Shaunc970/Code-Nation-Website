   <h2>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
  </div>
  <div  class="pstyle">
   <p>Websites have to contend with complying with a number of legal permissions regarding the use of 3rd party content, this includes a number of legal concepts which is normally referred to under the umbrella of copyright law this has multiple facets which are:
    <br>
    Trademarks:<br>
    Trademarks are usually quite misunderstood they are when a company claims ownership of a well known brand,product or name of theirs, for example iPhone is a trademark of Apple but phone is not and is generic. In regards to websites trademarks carries the most lax rules as they are allowed to be used and referenced as long as you do not claim ownership or association of the trademarked term, for example it is completely fine to make a blog discussing the announcement of the new iPhone however claiming you are manufacturing the new IPhone when you aren't would be a breach of trademark and could lead to legal trouble.
    <br>
    Copyright:<br>
    The next one is copyright itself, copyright applies to anywork made by a creator, this could be an image,code,music or any number of things.It also applies automatically and does not need to be explicitly stated by its creator. In terms of the web this means you cannot just post images and other 3rd party content without permission from its creator, so this should be considered when finding content for a site, permission can be given freely or for a license fee by its creator. The exception to this is fair use, fair use allows the criticism of a copyrighted work for example if you have a blog criticising a painting it is okay to display the image alongside the criticism for the purpose of its review.
    <br>
    Public Domain & Creative Commons:<br>
    
    Public Domain & Creative Commons are the last part, these are works that are free to use by everyone without any permission needed they cover two topics Public Domain which is works whose copyright has expired, for example Shakespeare’s works and CC works that in theory have copyright but whos creator has revoked it and said its free to use, for example royalty free images. When building a website you should consider if this applies to any of the third party content you have used and attempt to use it to avoid copyright claims.

        <h2> Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>
            There are a wide range of disabilities that could affect a user and their experience on a webpage. Websites should try to be as accessible as possible the main categories are:
            <br>
            Visual: <br>
            Visual covers the most common condition faced on the web which is visual impairment, this covers a wide array of conditions from partial blindness to color blindness. For example alternative colour themes should be considered for a website so that colour blind people can view it easily, many website builders offer tools to do this quickly and cheaply so it is a good way to increase accessibility. Similarly you should also account for visual impairment making sure stylesheets and the general layout of the site are comptabilite and readable with the built in reader accessibility tools of many browsers and devices is a large help, this can also be done on the site itself with text size options etc, many of these features will improve the user experience for many especially older demographics opening the site to new people.
            <br>
            Audio: <br>
            The next is audio this once again covers mainly two conditions one is deafness, this would only apply to websites with audio/visual content such as videos when adding this kind of content, designers should consider adding closed captions(subtitles) if they can to a video as this allows the deaf to still enjoy the content. Similarly many services such as youtube have free autocaption software which makes it easy to implement. The second audio consideration is if the written content makes sense and is laid out well with no broken html elements for narrator software that reads the page back to the reader this is extremely helpful to the blind and dyslexic users and can be achieved with careful planning. 
            <br>
            Motion: <br>  
            Lastly is motion this has been brought into light due to the prevalence of mobile phones and when designing web content for mobile this should be considered, it covers issues affecting people with limited dexterity and would affect the layout of pages usually these changes would be seen in a websites accessibility mode these changes include trying to keep content and web elements closer to the centre and options like bigger buttons for those with less precise movement. 
            </p>
         </div>

 <div class="H2style">
        <h2> Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>
            There are many different filetypes that are appropriate for the web, everything from jpegs for images to gifs for animations and webm for video. However they all have certain traits that make them web appropriate these are:
            <br>
Resource Cost:  <br>
This can actually have two meanings both of which are important the first is the cost to user resources this is how much memory it takes to cache the websites resources and how cpu intensive this is important as people will not interact with a website that is sluggish and takes too long to load so this should be considered, as all of these formats are compressors and reduce the load times and size of a file for example a 50kb jpeg loads a lot faster than a 8MB bitmap.However its not just user cost but cost to the website as everytime a server request is sent it costs money longer that request takes to fulfil the more cost to the website so web files tend to be resource “light”.
<br>
Compatibility:  <br>
Another reason is compatibility the web runs on many different devices and different hardware setups for this reason it is important to keep files in formats that are standards, for example any browser with HTML5 support can run WebM videos this means the content will work for every user without plugins this is a good choice to assure all visitors can see the content, similar standards exist for images “JPEG” and animations “GIF “ a less supported format may just not display at all.
<br>
Security:  <br>
The final and recent issue is that of user security with many sites succumbing to attacks like sideloading and SQL injections keeping the site secure is a must. Otherwise the site’s reputation could be ruined, once again this is where web standard formats are used for example a JPEG is only an image file it can only contain image data,  it cannot be used to run any can of malicious code which makes it a good choice for images. This is why recently browsers have pushed to end flash support as it is seen as a security risk this should be considered when choosing site content
