   <p>
    The main legal guidelines projects have to follow are the Data Protection Act,The Freedom of Information Act and The Right to be Forgotten. These have all been bundled into GDPR these regulations cover a lot of things however for digital projects they mainly are about the handling and storing of user data especially sensitive data, this includes everything from a persons address to their stated religion the main regulations are all about a person's data these break down into:
    <br>
    Justification:<br>
    Any digital project that gathers data needs to adequately justify why they are collecting that data and what they are using it for this would be a constraint as you cannot just gather information unjustly.
    <br>
    Consent:<br>
    Also under GDPR regulations the person whose data is being collected must be informed by law what is being collected and if they wish, the reason why and also the option to opt out of data collection that is not essential to the service. This should be considered on the project and how you would allow opting out.
    <br>
    Storing:<br>
    Another is storing this is actually where the data is held and handled for instance sensitive data could be held on a separate database from the main site, that is encrypted and salted and so on to protect it this is a consideration the project would have to ask if this is feasible.
    <br>
    Access:<br>
    Lastly is access every EU citizen has the right to request what information is stored on them by a company and this has to be performed in a certain time span. Projects should consider if they could perform this request when asked. </div>
