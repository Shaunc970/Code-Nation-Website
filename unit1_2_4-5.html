   <p>Improvements I could of made to my project if time was not a factor and the functionality completed would of been:
    <br>
    The main issue with the website currently that I would of worked on if there was no time constraints would of the been the visual and user interface side of the project, I would of done more things such as better utilisation of images and overall just made the site more pleasant to look at and interact with this could of included things such as the use of buttons on the site rather then text links. I would have also made a number of accessibility changes such as the use of different colour schemes and themes on the website both for people who are colour blind and if users want a darker theme for less eye strain while interacting with the site. These changes would also of included alt descriptions for partially sighted users so their narrator software can read descriptions of the content.</p>

        <h2>Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>After testing my project I can conclude that the project has matched the requirements and is fit for purpose. First and foremost the first success factor was if all of the required content is available and accessible, this is complete and all of the content is there. The next success factor would be if the site was functional by which I mean does all of the features work and have the expected outcome, once again I can say yes it does all of the links work and point to the correct place and all of the content views correctly without errors.Next would be the visual side this was the most strenuous part of the project as it is time consuming however I would say it does meet outcomes as I have implemented what we were taught in CSS into the website, however if time constraints were not a factor this could be improved on.</p>
