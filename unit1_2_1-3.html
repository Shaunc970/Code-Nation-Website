   <p>making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?
The tools we used for this project were Visual Studio Code and Trello I would say I am happy with these tools because:
<br>
Visual Studio Code: <br>
Visual Studio Code is an extremely diverse coding platform which has support to run and compile all three of the languages we used. Ultimately it allowed us to build our website this made it extremely convenient to build our website as there was no need to switch in and out of different interfaces, especially as not only does it support them but also includes error checking and debugging for all three.
<br>
Trello: <br>
Trello was how we managed our website development, Trello turns projects into “Boards” these boards then allow us to place all the different tasks of the project on this board. This was useful for our project as it is visually driven allowing us to order and prioritise our tasks as well as see our progress in real time as this project was time limited being able to prioritise is a must as we most likely would of not achieved all features we wanted.Another reason is Trello supports the kanban method of assigning work into to do, doing,done allowing us to monitor our progress. For managing small projects it is extremely useful.</p>

        <h2>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>When deciding if the tools used were appropriate, there are two approaches to take, if they were appropriate for our project and if they are appropriate overall as web development tools. the two tools we used were:
            <br>
Visual Studio Code:<br>
Visual Studio Code was our main programming interface a basic check of if it was appropriate was if we met our outcomes, which is what we have done for this project for designing our website this was a more then sufficient tool because the main reason for this was that VSC contains support for all 3 languages we used to make our project and also allowed for the interconnection and compiling of all these languages to have a fully functioning website.
<br>
Trello:<br>
Trello was the tool we used for our project management, I think this was an appropriate choice as it allowed us to organise and prioritise our workload and scope of the project. It was more than sufficient as it supports the kanban method we were using and is extremely simple to use while also displaying the information in an easily understandable view.. However for a larger project this may not be sufficient.</p>

        <h2> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>As with any project the final product produced has both advantages and disadvantages this was compounded by the limited time to reproduce, however the strengths and weaknesses are as follows:
            <br>
            Strengths<br>
            The main strength of my website is that 100% of the functionality is there. I've tested it to make sure all of the features work and I am happy to report they do. All links are functioning and all of the content pages are in and available, so this would just leave aesthetic improvements to be done. Another strength is the uniformity of the theme I have a set colour palette as well as certain fonts for headers and paragraphs this gives the site a defined style, as well as makes it visually navigable as users can see from the fonts and layout what’s a title, what's the content, etc.
            <br>
            Weaknesses<br>
            The main drawback of my website lies in its aesthetics as there is currently only limited use of CSS. However the upside to this is that this is mainly due to time constraints, But in its current state the visuals are lacklustre and not where I would want them to be. For example although we have limited mobile support using Flexboxes this is not full support for different device sizes and if I had time I would change this, similarly I think that the site uses images to sparsely and would work on this further, however this is still progress from the draft including fixing the issues related to the navbar and white spacing appearing behind them.</p>
