   <h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
  </div>
  <div  class="pstyle">
   <p>
    <br>
    The way I would test any digital solutions is to create a list of criteria that would define if I see the project as a success or not and then compare the project and its functionally against this criteria for example when testing the website I would want to make sure that all of the links work and redirect to the correct places and that all of the content views correctly. The best way to do this would be to breakdown testing into whats being tested, the expected result and the actual result.This would be the quickest way to establish what needs changing it is also best to do the testing as new content is being created as otherwise you may forgot to test parts of a large project or even break something that was previously functioning.</p>

        <h2>Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>I have 9 pages which contain all of the content for this project, the layout I have chosen is to display blocks of content into two or threes to not overwhelm the page with content. The content breaks down via the different units of the work assigned for example unit 1.1-1.3 is one page and this continues like this for all units, I have used the font Questrial for headings and other large text elements and Lato for the body of the content. The content of the site is mainly text due to the nature of the project.</p>
