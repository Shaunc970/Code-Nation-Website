   <h2>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
  </div>
  <div  class="pstyle">
   <p>
    There are multiple risks that could impact a digital project. They can be broken down into three broad categories; they are Technical,Security and Human risks:.
    <br>
    Technical:<br>
    Firstly are technical issues, these cover a wide range of issues that could stop a project. For example if everything related to the project is stored on the cloud, should the service go down or the workers internet cut out without any local backups, it would completely stop any progress on the project.
    <br>
    Security:<br>
    The second would be security, these issues can relate to both outside malicious attacks, but also internal.An external threat would be something like ransomware should the worker become infected this could destroy a lot of the project, this is why it is important to keep backups and machines updated with good security suites. Internal would be rogue team members targeting the project to circumvent this backups and suitable permissions and access should be used to avoid setbacks.
    <br>
    Human:<br>
    The third is human, this includes risks such as delays to the project because of team members not finishing their work and delaying others, this can be kept in check using tools such as Trello to keep on top of what is being worked on.</p>

        <h2> Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>
            When you are selecting what IT systems and software to use there are 3 main considerations, they can all affect each other as well as potentially being completely separate issues. Depending on the project, one could be prioritised over the other these breakdown as follows:
            <br>
Features:<br>
This is the most obvious of the three when deciding what tools to use, as it sounds it is researching and comparing different offerings on the market to see if it fits all or most of your needs. This is a two fold job, the first being actually figuring out what features you need, This is best done by breaking down the project and seeing what each part would require, for example our use of Slack, one of the primary draws was we needed a group messaging service that could support and display code. The second is the actual research of what's on the market, this can be done in a number of way from merely searching your required features and seeing what products contain them, to researching what is the industry standard for your industry, see our use of Trello we used it as it is extremely popular among developers and has excellent kanban support.
<br>
Budget:<br>
The next consideration is budget. Most projects do not have an unlimited budget, So even if you find a perfect solution it could be over what you can afford, to evaluate this it is best to first define your budget, and then prioritise what features are most necessary and what are closer to nice to haves, and then comparing what's available and remove nice to haves one by one until you have a suitable product. For example our use of zoom has a 40 minute limitation, however for our needs this is just more of a minor inconvenience with not too large an impact and therefore doesn't need changing.
<br>
Time:<br>
The last and often overlooked one is time, more so the time to use a software and the time to learn it, this is very project dependant but can be of great importance for example if you are working to a strict deadline, buying a piece of software that greatly cuts down the time of a repetitive and slow task may be worth the investment, if it means the project is done on time. Similarly using software that takes a long time to learn and is overly complicated for the project you are doing could be a waste of time and ultimately slow you down, even if it would make you more efficient after learning it.This can be seen in our used of VSCode, is their other platforms which are strictly made with the quirks of each language we have used in mind yes certainly, would it be worth the hassle of switching in and out of these and teaching everyone how to use them for our projects not likely.</p>

       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>
            Throughout this project we have mainly used 4 tools to accomplish our project they are as follows:
            <br>
            Zoom:<br>
            Zoom is a video conferencing platform that we have used for organising the group and discussing the project the reason we used zoom over competitors such as skype and teams is for a multitude of reasons for example it offers better audio quality then skype it also gives more control to the host as anyone can ring a skype group this disorganisation could of slowed us down and it is also easy to install with little setup over something like teams, with its main drawback being the 40 minute call limit however this is only a minor inconvenience for us.
            <br>
            Trello:<br>
            Trello is a project management tool in our case we used Trello to perform a number of Project Management tasks we use a trello board over other management tools first and foremost because it has great support for our management style Kanban which is breaking down tasks into small chunks and assigning them as todo,doing,done Trello offers us a great visual representation of this.It also allows real time editing by multiple people which means we could get feedback in real time and lastly was its simplicity which is an advantage for us but a limitation for larger projects for us however it being User interface driven such as drag and dropping really increased its ease of us.
            <br>
            VSCode<br>
            VSCode this is a robust programming interface that we have been using in our coding projects we used this tool for one made reason its versatility as it supports a number of languages including all of the ones we used in this project as well as having many quality of life features such as good error checking and suggestion support for all the languages we have been using the drawback is there are other platforms which are strictly made with the quirks of each language we have used in mind but for the complexity of our work it would not be worth the time investment.
