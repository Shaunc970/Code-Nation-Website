   <h2>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
  </div>
  <div  class="pstyle">
   <p>
    At its most basic level the purpose of IT in business is to increase productivity and efficiency of a task. If you take for example accounting it used to be a labour intensive process with manual calculations, on a computer can perform these tasks with ease and within seconds.
    
    One of the main things they allow is what is referred to as AGILE business and development, due to the nature of computers they allow on the fly adjust and editing of products and work. In the development world this means apps and sites can be compiled and tested quickly as well as updates and changes applied almost instantly, however this affects more than just tech jobs. For example previously if a publishing house made a spelling mistake the page would have to be rewritten now it can be changed instantly on a word processor, IT has allowed many industries to work faster and be more tolerant of mistakes as they are now easily removed.
    
    Another is business communication, a business that operates in multiple nations and offices used to have to write to the other parts of the business which takes along time to arrive and is no good for quick changes or, they would have to arrange a conference call which are limited and require accounting for time zones and other factors. IT allows businesses to have near instant communication, now changes can just be sent in a company wide email or posted on slack, IT communication makes miscommunication between teams less likely.</p>

        <h2> Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>
            Many of the skills needed in digital projects are similar to traditional project management. This includes planning and timekeeping skills to keep a project organised and progressing efficiently, an example of this would be the Kanban system as organising the project into smaller tasks of to do, doing and done, allows the team to keep focused and also see their progress in the done section. The tool used to do this, would be the project management tool Trello which allows you to split the project down in small parts and assign them around the team.On a more fundamental level the context of the project also affects what tools you need for example, if a project is being worked on remotely or while travelling a laptop would be used due to its portability, similarity having the skill to organise meetings and effectively communicate would be needed along with tools like zoom.</p>

        <h2> Plan and carry out tasks using IT â€“ e.g. making your website</h2>
       </div>
       <div  class="pstyle">
        <p>
            To plan and perform our tasks using IT in this case building a website we will use and it is advised to use a number of tools for us these are:
            <br>
A Project Management Tool(Trello):<br>
The first one is a project management tool in our case we will be using Trello. These tools perform a number of functions one is the use of a collaborative organisation space, for example in our Trello board we will be using the Kanban method, this is where all the tasks of a project are split into smaller self contained chunks and then arranged into 3 categories, to do,doing,done. This structure allows you to time-keep better and work more efficiently, as you can see what tasks you have completed and how far along a project. You can prioritise the most urgent tasks to keep focused and see what's left on a project, which gives you a greater sense of how long the project will take as well as ensuring it remains organised. For us it helps us see all parts of the website that needs to be constructed and gives us clear idea of what needs to be done.
<br>
A Communication Tool(Slack):<br>
The next is a communication tool in our case the messaging service Slack, projects are rarely done alone and usually involve a team. Tools like Slack support a versatile array of ways to communicate, everything from messages to images,Email style reply threads to displaying code. A tool like this allows teams to communicate effectively even when done remotely, and its array of format support means that costly miscommunication that delays projects is a lot less likely. For our website it is a one stop shop for all of our needed materials and can be used to reference the objectives and outcomes of the project, as well being a platform to ask for any assistance almost instantly if necessary.
<br>
A Implementation Tool(VSCode):<br>
The final tool needed would be something to actually carry out the tasks. This varies wildly depending on what the project actually involves, so we can only really discuss the one for our project. In this case we will be using VSCode, this is a robust programming interface that we will be constructing our website in. When selecting an implementation tool is that it can actually do the job in our case VS certainly can, as it supports all the languages we will use and has extensive error checking and suggestion support, which helps reduce errors occurring and delaying progress.</p>
